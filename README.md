# streamsx.transform
This toolkit contains general-purpose operators that do tuple manipulation.  Currently, the only operator it contains is Modify, but operators that perform joins and aggregations fit would fit in this toolkit.

General-purpose operators that perform manipulations on streams without looking at the tuples should go into streamsx.plumbing.
